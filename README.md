# ore-miner-shell-scripts

## Purpose
To make it easy to manage ore mining, claiming and monitoring


## Monitoring
Currently the monitoring tool pushes data to my personal website.
https://mjkabir.com/orectrl/report

I will change this in the future.



## Custom Helius RPC
Keep your custom Helius RPC key in your own .zshrc .bashrc or whatever shell you use
and export it in your .[zsh|bash]rc file as:

export RPC_API_KEY=your-private API for the RPC

Example:
export RPC_API_KEY=dxxxxxxx-a555-4999-8AAAA-34444444
